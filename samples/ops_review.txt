[00:00] Kraven: We missed two SLAs last week—ticket #247 and #249. Root cause?
[00:03] Diana: The monitoring alert didn’t fire. I’ll fix the threshold misconfiguration today.
[00:06] Alexander: We also need to update the incident playbook with the new escalation contacts.
[00:10] Kraven: Please do that by Friday noon.
[00:13] Diana: Will do. Also, can we automate the daily uptime report generation?
[00:16] Alexander: I can script that in Python. I’ll send a draft version by Monday.
[00:20] Kraven: Great. Schedule a dry run next Wednesday.
[00:23] Diana: Done.
