[00:00] Emily: The client raised concerns about the dashboard load times.
[00:03] Nikhil: Yeah, they said the first render takes over 6 seconds on mobile.
[00:06] Emily: We should profile the frontend bundle size.
[00:09] Nikhil: I’ll run Lighthouse tests today and share results.
[00:12] Priya: I’ll handle the content feedback—they want to rename "Revenue Summary" to "Performance Overview".
[00:15] Emily: Okay, update the design file and push a new version by tomorrow 3 PM.
[00:19] Nikhil: Also, their team asked for a PDF export option. 
[00:22] Priya: Let’s scope that for next sprint, not now.
[00:25] Emily: Agreed. I’ll communicate that in the follow-up email today.
